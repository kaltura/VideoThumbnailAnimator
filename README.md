# Kaltura Video Thumbnails Animator
Video thumbnails using Kaltura's Image Transformation API and JavaScript. Including low-rest blurred loading while animation stripe loads in the backgroud.

This script uses percentages based CSS logic to create responsive animated video thumbnails with CSS stripes of the video animation frames created by the [Kaltura Thumbnail API](https://developer.kaltura.com/api-docs/Engage_and_Publish/kaltura-thumbnail-api.html/).  

The logic used is as follow:
* Thumbnail Stripe Width in Percentage: total slices multiplied by 100. 
* Thumbnail Stripe X Position in Percentage: the total slices minus 1 (0-index) described as percent (100 divided by total slices minus 1), multiplied by the current slice nunmber (0-index).
